            <p>Hi! If you are looking for a legit web developer geek then you are at the right place. I have spent the
                last
                couple of years on web development and gained pretty much good knowledge and experience from the work I
                have
                done. I can amaze you with my web development skills. In web development, I mainly work in Html , Css,
                React,
                Bootstrap, Javascript, Mongodb etc.

            <h1>My Journey</h1>
            <h3>To become a programmer.</h3>
            <p>I love Designing since I was a small kid. I did research online and I found out online tutorials of
                Coding & Designing. There are a lot of online resources for web development, so I’d definitely utilize
                that. I learned how to program by working on lots of different websites project starting from a pretty
                young age. So I decided to make my love for my job.

                I’ve always said that most of my knowledge and skill’s have been learned through self-teaching,
                experimenting and following tutorials online.

                I always recommend for people to simply get stuck in and enjoy what they’re doing, and don’t worry too
                much about the certificates</p>
